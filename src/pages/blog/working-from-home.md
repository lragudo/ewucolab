Code in the Dark is a front-end (HTML, CSS) competition, originating from a small development group in Europe, where each contestant competes to implement a website design given only a screenshot. The catch is that no previews of the results are allowed during the implementation, and no measuring tools can be used. After 15 minutes, the results are viewed by everyone all at once, and the winner is decided by the audience.
